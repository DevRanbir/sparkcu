Spark Ideathon: Complete Overview
The 

Spark Ideathon is a hackathon-style competition for the 2025-26 academic session, organized by the Department of CSE at Chandigarh University. It's designed specifically for 


1st and 2nd-year Bachelor of Engineering (CSE) students to encourage creativity, innovation, and problem-solving.




Event Structure and Evaluation
The event is broken down into three main parts, with a clear focus on the presentation of ideas.


Expert Guidance: Mentorship sessions with industry experts and university professors will be held to help teams refine their ideas and understand the necessary tools and technologies.



PPT Presentation (Main Evaluation): This is the core of the competition and is worth 10 marks. Teams are judged on their PowerPoint presentation based on the following criteria:




Problem Understanding & Relevance: 2 marks 


Creativity & Innovation: 3 marks 


Technical Feasibility / Implementation: 2 marks 


Presentation & Communication: 3 marks 


Coding Contest (Optional): This is an optional, quiz-based contest with multiple-choice questions designed to award bonus marks. The contest has three rounds: Web Development, General Programming, and App Development. The bonus marks are awarded as follows:






Participation in any round: +0.5 marks 



Best in one category (e.g., Web, App, or General): +1 mark 



Overall Topper (best in at least two categories): +2 marks 


The total score is 

capped at 10, meaning these are bonus points to help teams reach the maximum score.
