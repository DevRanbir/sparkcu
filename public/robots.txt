- One Team Leader must be appointed for communication

### AI Usage Rules
- AI is allowed for idea generation & coding contest support
- **AI is NOT allowed for direct PPT creation** (e.g., Gamma, Canva premade templates, or similar well-known design platforms)
- Using prohibited AI tools for PPT creation = **direct disqualification**
- Teams must present in their own words; AI-generated text must be customized

### Coding Contest Rules
- Participation earns +0.5 mark, Best in Category = +1, Best in at least 2 = +2
- Contest will be **time-limited** – fastest and most accurate teams secure top positions
- Use of AI is allowed in contest, but the faster team will be the winner

### PPT Presentation Rules
- Strict adherence to **time limit (5–6 minutes)**
- Every team must give the floor to the Team Leader at least once
